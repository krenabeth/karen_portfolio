			<p class="snazzy">After working as a librarian for thirteen years, I'm taking the great adventure of a career change into web development. The little bit of javascript I've learned has been a lot of fun.</p>

			<p class="snazzy">I live in Commerce Township with my 7 year old son. I've also lived in Fenton, White Lake, and West Bloomfield, and know some of the good bike trails and beaches in those areas. I like hiking as well and spotting wildlife. This year we've been seeing sandhill cranes in our yard. </p>

			<p class="snazzy">My cat Roosevelt likes to sit on reading material whenever possible. He's the best. Except when he's being a rascal.</p>

			<p class="snazzy">Some favorite things... bike trails at Kensington and Indian Springs Metroparks... libraries in the metro Detroit area - the Milford Public Library and the <a href="http://waterfordmi.gov/library">Waterford Township Public Library</a>... animals at the zoo - anteaters</p>
