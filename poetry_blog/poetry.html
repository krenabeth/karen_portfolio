            Don't forget that cats enjoy being read to - whether poetry, fiction, or nonfiction - they delight in getting up and either leaving the room or turning to face the other direction when you begin to read aloud.</p>

              <p>Have you reckoned a thousand acres much? Have you reckoned the earth much? Have you practiced so long to learn to read? Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems? Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems, You shall possess the good of the earth and sun . . . . there are millions of suns left, You shall no longer take things at second or third hand . . . . nor look through the eyes of the dead . . . . nor feed on the spectres in books, You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me, You shall listen to all sides and filter them from yourself. I have heard what the talkers were talking . . . . the talk of the beginning and the end, But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.
